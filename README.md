ShadowFox was inspired by changes made in Firefox 57, which limited the amount addons could customize both the user interface and "protected" web pages.

This project aims at creating a universal dark theme for Firefox while adhering to the modern design principles set by Mozilla.

## Preview

ShadowFox styles the entire user interface, protected webpages (such as `about:` pages and addons.mozilla.org), and over 40 popular addons.

## Installation and Updating

### For Firefox 69 and up

Navigate to `about:config` and enable:

* `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`

## For Firefox before 69

A cross-platform installer/uninstaller/updater is maintained in the [shadowfox-updater](https://github.com/SrKomodo/shadowfox-updater) repository.  Latest versions can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/SrKomodo/shadowfox-updater/releases) section, or via `Homebrew`, `MacPorts`, and `AUR`.

## Customization

It's easy to customize ShadowFox.  You can choose what colors are used, what elements and webpages are styled, or add your own css tweaks.  For more information, see [here](https://github.com/overdodactyl/ShadowFox/wiki/Customization).  

Depending on how much you want to customize ShadowFox, you may be better suited using a different installation process.  To learn more, see [here](https://github.com/overdodactyl/ShadowFox/wiki/Development).
